**Description:**

In this notebook, I have constructed a deep neural network using Keras to classify MNIST Fashion images, which is essentially an image recognition mission. This exercise allowed me to gain a better understanding of building and training deep neural networks.

**About Dataset:** <br>
The Fashion-MNIST dataset contains 70,000 grayscale images of fashion products, with each image being 28x28 pixels in size. These products are classified into 10 distinct categories, with 7,000 images per category. The dataset is divided into a training set with 60,000 images and a test set with 10,000 images. Fashion-MNIST has the same image size, data format, and training/testing split structure as the original MNIST dataset.

**Conclusion:**<br> 
- The project involved building a deep neural network using Keras to classify images from the Fashion-MNIST dataset.
- The dataset contains 70,000 grayscale images of fashion products, with 10 distinct categories and 7,000 images per category.
- The training set consists of 60,000 images and the test set has 10,000 images.
- By working with this dataset, the project provided a better understanding of building and training deep neural networks for image recognition tasks.
- The successful classification of the Fashion-MNIST images demonstrates the efficacy of deep neural networks in categorizing complex images into various distinct categories.
- The project highlights the significance of utilizing deep learning algorithms to solve complex image recognition problems.
