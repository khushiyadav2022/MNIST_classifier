# MNIST Fashion_classifier
MNIST classifier-Neural network model(Deep learning project)

**Description:**

In this notebook, I have built a deep neural network on MNIST Fashion images to classify them.So, it is actually an image recognition task.It helps me to understand and built a deep neural network with Keras.


**About Dataset:** Fashion-MNIST is a dataset comprising of 28Ã—28 grayscale images of 70,000 fashion products from 10 categories, with 7,000 images per category. The training set has 60,000 images and the test set has 10,000 images. Fashion-MNIST shares the same image size, data format and the structure of training and testing splits with the original MNIST.
